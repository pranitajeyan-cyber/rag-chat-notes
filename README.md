# 📚 RAG Chat with Your Notes

**Chat with your study documents using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).**  
Upload PDFs and text files, then ask questions — the AI answers using only your content.

Built as an M.Tech CSE project. Works with free APIs (Gemini, Groq) or fully local (Ollama).

---

## ✨ Features

- **Document Ingestion** — Upload PDF, TXT, or Markdown files
- **Smart Chunking** — Documents split into overlapping chunks for better retrieval
- **Vector Search** — Finds the most relevant chunks using sentence embeddings (runs locally, free)
- **LLM-Powered Answers** — Generates answers using Gemini, Groq, or local Ollama
- **Source Citations** — Every answer shows which documents were used
- **Beautiful UI** — Clean chat interface with dark sidebar, source badges, and document management
- **Document Management** — View, delete indexed documents from the sidebar

### Data Flow

1. **Upload** → Documents are loaded (PDF/TXT/MD)
2. **Chunk** → Split into overlapping pieces (configurable size)
3. **Embed** → Each chunk converted to a vector using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
4. **Store** → Vectors saved in ChromaDB (on disk)
5. **Query** → Your question is embedded with the same model
6. **Retrieve** → Top-k most similar chunks fetched from ChromaDB
7. **Generate** → LLM receives chunks as context + your question → answers

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- [Download Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (or just download ZIP from GitHub)

### 1. Download the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pranitajeyan-cyber/rag-chat-notes.git
cd rag-chat-notes
```
Or download ZIP from [github.com/pranitajeyan-cyber/rag-chat-notes](https://github.com/pranitajeyan-cyber/rag-chat-notes)

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up LLM (pick one)

#### Option A: Google Gemini ✅ (recommended — free tier)
1. Get a **free API key** → [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Create `.env` file from example and add your key:
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```
3. Open `.env` in Notepad and set: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here`

#### Option B: Groq 🚀 (free, very fast)
1. Get a **free API key** → [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. In `.env` set: `LLM_PROVIDER=groq` and `GROQ_API_KEY=your-key`

#### Option C: Ollama 💻 (fully local, no API key needed)
1. Download & install → [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
2. Open terminal and run: `ollama pull llama3.2`
3. In `.env` set: `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama`

### 4. Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Your browser will open at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) 🎉

## 🎮 How to Use (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Upload Documents
Look at the **sidebar (left panel)** → click **"Browse files"** → select your PDF, TXT, or Markdown files. You can upload multiple at once.

### Step 2: Wait for Indexing
You'll see a spinner "Indexing documents..." followed by a green success message like:
> ✅ Indexed 15 chunks from 2 file(s)

Your files are now stored in the vector database.

### Step 3: Verify Your Documents
The sidebar shows all indexed documents under **"Indexed Documents"**. You can delete any document by clicking **✕** next to it.

### Step 4: Ask a Question
Type your question in the **chat input box** at the bottom of the page and press Enter. For example:

> What is transfer learning in machine learning?

### Step 5: Read the Answer
The AI responds using **only your uploaded documents**. Every answer shows **source badges** — small green labels indicating which document(s) provided the information.

### Step 6: Tweak Settings (Optional)
In the sidebar, adjust **"Chunks to retrieve"** — higher values (6-10) give more context but may include irrelevant info. Lower values (1-3) are stricter.

### Quick Test
The repo includes `docs/sample.txt` with ML fundamentals. Upload it and ask:
- "What are the types of machine learning?"
- "What is overfitting?"
- "Explain the bias-variance tradeoff"
